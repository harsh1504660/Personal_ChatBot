My personal background:
My name is Harsh Joshi, and I was born on 15th September 2004 in Nashik, a vibrant city in Maharashtra, India.
I am fluent in Marathi, Hindi, and English, and I also possess a basic understanding of Sanskrit.
I value clear communication and cultural diversity, which helps me connect with people from different backgrounds.


My strengths:
I am a quick and adaptive learner, capable of grasping new concepts efficiently.
One of my key strengths is multi-tasking‚ÄîI can manage multiple responsibilities simultaneously without compromising on quality.
I perform best under pressure and often deliver my highest potential when working with tight deadlines or challenging conditions.

My Education :
I completed my schooling up to the 10th grade at Anand Niketan School, an innovative and progressive institution located in Nashik.
For my junior college education (11th and 12th), I attended H.P.T. & R.Y.K. Arts and Science College, Nashik.
Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Dr. D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi, Pune.
I am expected to graduate in 2026.

My projects :
I have done multiple projects like smart-answer-evaluator, Hand gesture VLC media controller, and Early stage Diabetes detector, And currently building the project in EdTech field.

project : üß† Smart answer evaluator : 
Overview:
A web-based AI tool that allows an invigilator to input both a student‚Äôs answer and the ideal answer. The system then evaluates the student‚Äôs response and allocates marks based on the maximum marks defined by the user.

Technical Details:
Utilized BERT architecture, specifically S-BERT, to encode the pair of answers (student + ideal answer).
Generated synthetic training data using OpenAI APIs, including variations of student responses labeled as incorrect, partially correct, or correct.
Designed a custom scoring formula that computes final marks based on the probability distribution across the three classes and the max marks provided.
Implemented soft-checking and hard-checking modes by dynamically adjusting classification thresholds to allow flexible grading policies.

Tech Stack:
Model: Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow
Backend: Flask, FastAPI
Frontend: HTML, CSS   

project : ‚úã Hand gesture VLC media controller 
Overview:
Developed an AI-powered gesture recognition system to control VLC Media Player through predefined hand signs. This system allows users to control playback (play, pause, next, previous, volume up/down) using only hand gestures.

Technical Details:
Trained a deep learning model using the HaGrid dataset to classify various hand gestures.
Integrated the gesture prediction with VLC's API, enabling real-time multimedia control.

Tech Stack:
Modeling: TensorFlow
Integration: VLC Media Player API
Dataset: HaGrid

project : ü©∫ Early stage Diabetes detector
Overview:
A machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of early-stage diabetes based on medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, hypertension, and more, achieving 97% accuracy.

Technical Details:
Collected and preprocessed structured health data.
Built classification models using various algorithms and selected the best-performing one based on validation accuracy and ROC-AUC.
Provided a user-friendly interface for health professionals or individuals to input parameters and get instant predictions.

Tech Stack:
Modeling: Scikit-learn
UI/Deployment: Streamlit

My Work Experience:
Agri Spectra AI,Austria as a Data Science Intern
During this 6-month internship, I contributed across multiple stages of AI-driven agricultural diagnostics, working with cutting-edge technologies in deep learning, hyperspectral imaging, and geospatial data processing.

üî¨ Phase 1: Plant Disease Detection using 2D CNNs
Collected and merged multiple public datasets to create a robust dataset of 120,000+ plant images spanning 117 disease classes.

Trained and fine-tuned deep learning models such as ResNet and EfficientNet using TensorFlow/Keras.

Achieved a classification accuracy of ~89%, optimizing for real-world field conditions and imbalanced classes.

Performed advanced data preprocessing and augmentation to enhance generalization.

üåà Phase 2: Hyperspectral Imaging & 3D Deep Learning
Transitioned to hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for finer disease classification.

Collected HSI data for grapevine diseases using Copernicus Sentinel satellite imagery.

Developed and benchmarked models such as HSI Transformer and Hyper3DNet, achieving an accuracy of 83% on raw pixel-level classification tasks.

Integrated MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and reproducibility across model versions.

üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Building the MVP Web Platform
Built the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Agri Spectra AI using modern web technologies:

Frontend: TypeScript, React

Backend: Node.js

Database: Firebase Realtime DB

Implemented geospatial features such as:

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculation

Soil moisture estimation

Field-level analytics using Google Earth Engine API
Integrated an interactive map-based interface allowing users to select fields and instantly retrieve vegetation and soil health metrics.
